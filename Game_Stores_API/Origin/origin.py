"""
Thing to consider:
Not all store pages show the prices on the first page you get to from the search page
For example, SW:BF2 has the price on its landing page
But Battlefield 1 doesn't because it is on Origin Access and clicking buy now gives you the option to select
buy now or get origin access
As such this means this is a low priority for now
